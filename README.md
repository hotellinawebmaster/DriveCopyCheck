This is an old project based on Google Drive APIs made with Java & JavaFX in Netbeans IDE.

The project is now old as most of the web Google APIs need to be upgraded.
It was retrieveing the entire list of files and folder from your own Google Drive account and it was displaying those via a JavaFX interface.
Search operations on those files were also possible.

The first screen shows a Client secret and a Client ID, with these being secret keys needed by Google to an aplication to operate with your own Google account. After that you were invited to enter your Google password for only then getting a sort of web token where all APIs requests operations were allowed.
