This is an educational project based on Google Drive APIs.
Youtube Video of the final project is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5ua5Bu-SlQ 

The project is now old as most of the web Google APIs need to be upgraded.
IT was retrieveing the entire list of files and folder from your own Google Drive account and it was displaying those via a JavaFX interface.
Search operations on those files were also possible.
